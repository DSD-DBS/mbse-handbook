# Introduction

This site provides DBS MBSE Handbook. This is a WIP translation of parts of internal documentation that are considered useful in external / collaborative context. Not all materials are migrated here already.

Most of it is still internal but we are committed to shift it to public space over time. 
We will start by publishing some parts of our modeling rules that may be relevant to our partners or collaboration projects.

This repository and related workflows will be used to conduct further development of MBSE Handbook as well as maintain discussions around it.
Improvement suggestions may be contributed by reporting an issue or opening a discussion.

## Motivation for making DBS MBSE Handbook open to public

It is very difficult to operate or develop complex systems without MBSE. 

Implementation of MBSE itself within an organization can also be a difficult journey. 

Part of that journey is to explain to the organization how exactly can it be applied to a task at hand to get the expected results.

Through our collaboration projects we see that many other organizations are on the same journey and trying to answer the same questions and that doing it together may save us time and effort while adding transparency / demystifying the process and reasoning behind the modeling methods and rules.
